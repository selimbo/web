    <p>on his way back home . weird event happens<br>
        <br>
he saw a man raping a woman , he wasnt scared<br>
<br>
he ran toward them, BAM<br>
<br>
he crashed into a huge tv screen and fainted<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
he woke up and found himself in a room<br>
<br>
a table , on top of it a paper and a pen<br>
<br>
paper:" chingi,<br>
<br>
we will grant you any wish if you lend us your power<br>
<br>
'a place to sign'" (( writing is ugly ))
<br><br>
chingi : " fix your writing and dw i ll sign it "
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Door opens , a masked (weird one) man comes in
<br><br>
holding a pen and starts writing from behind 
<br><br>
chingi : " hurry the fuck up "
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
chingi : " Any wish huh ? "
<br><br>
masked guy writes on another paper : "Abseloutely Chingi"
<br><br>
chingi : " Wait how do you know that i have a power in the first place ? and why 
would you need it ? "
<br><br>
masked guy writes : "Look you either sign or you die"
<br><br>
chingi: " Come on ! leave me alone ! " 
<br><br>
masked guy writes : "No one will know about it"
<br><br>
chingi: " IDC anyways , go ahead and kill me "
<br><br>
masked guy grabs an axe and swings it at chingi
<br><br>
chingi somehow moves the chair to dodge and touches the masked guy
<br><br>
masked guy freaks the fuck out
<br><br>
chingi :" Wait why doesn't it work "
<br><br>
masked guy : " wait , why can i move ? "
<br><br>
P.S: Chingi's power : if he touches or sees or hears someone he has the ability
to control him  ( no need to mention this )
<br><br>
chingi thinking : " Oh Fuck ! i used it on the test today "
<br><br>
masked guy: " Okey finally i can talk , i thought you didnt't use it.
this is your last chance or i am gonna fuck you up "
